    The three sematic tags that must be on every page you create are header, main, footer. 
    Note the below comment is how  a multi-line comment should be written.

    Most sematic tags are containers. Bad practice to not include an HTML element that goes inside the container.
    The exception is <figcaption>.
    State what type of conetnt you want to put in the container. 
    They need actual HTML elemnets inside them.
    Just putting text inside a fotter without a p tag or an h2 tag is not acceptable. 

    Never use a <span> that spands over the entire content.

          <h2>What is Classic Rock?</h2>
          <p>
            "<span id="definition">Classic Rock</span> is a US radio fromat
            developed from the album-oriented rock (AOR) format in the early
            1980s.In the United States, the classic rock format comprises rock
            music ranging generally from the mid-1960s through the mid 1990s,
            primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard
            rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format. The radio format became
